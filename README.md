# MySQL-to-Docker_Container
 If you have several software applications installed on your system and are running out of drive space, but you can't uninstall the software because it contains important work that you might need in the future, Docker containers can be a solution.

# Acknowledgement
- If you donâ€™t know what Docker is or how it works, first learn about it.
- Next, read the Notion notes and follow the commands.
- You will be able to work with Docker if you follow the notes carefully.
 
# I have created Notion notes. Visit this website and follow all the steps.
